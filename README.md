| --- | --- | --- |
| eureka_hostname | hostname of eureka server | service-registry |
| mongodb_hostname | hostname of mongodb | customer-db |
| mongodb\_database\_name | database name | customerDB |

### Using Docker

Create docker bridge network: `docker network create -d bridge pigihi-network`

docker-compose can be used to run the application and the corresponding mongodb instance

1.  Go to project folder
2.  Open terminal and run `docker-compose up`
3.  The application can be accessed at localhost:8091 (port 8091 is set in docker-compose)
4.  MongoDB port is set to 27016

To run only the application

1.  Go to project folder
2.  Open terminal and run `docker build .`
3.  Run `docker run -p 8091:8091 docker_image_name`
4.  The application can be accessed at localhost:8091

### Using Gradle

MongoDB should be run seperately and the configurations should be updated in application.yml

1.  Go to project folder
2.  Open terminal and run `./gradlew build`
3.  Run `./gradlew bootRun`
